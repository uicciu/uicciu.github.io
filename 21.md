# Algebraic Attack on Convolutional Neural1 Network with Max Pooling
> (2+1) SIMPLE CNN CRYPTANALYTIC EXTRACTION PROJECT

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete process of successfully recovering the weights of a two-layer (2+1) CNN model trained on MNIST dataset under the **black-box scenario**.

## Model Architecture
We consider a lightweight CNN for MNIST consisting of two convolutional layers with max-pooling, followed by one fully connected layers:

1×32×32

→ Conv(1→1, 5×5) + ReLU → MaxPool(2×2)

→ Conv(1→1, 5×5) + ReLU → MaxPool(2×2)

→ Flatten (5×5 = 25)

→ FC1(25→18) 

→ FC(18→10)

## Brief Description of Key Files

1. **AttackCNN_Function.py**:Contains functions for recovering the weights of the first convolutional layer.
2. **AttackCNN2_Function.py**:Contains functions for recovering the weights of the second convolutional layer.


## Explanation of this Codebase
This codebase bases its structure from Carlini et al's codebase that can be found under https://github.com/google-research/cryptanalytic-model-extraction.All convolutional and max-pooling specific components are implemented independently in this work.

## Installation

> pip install torch numpy scipy jax jaxlib matplotlib networkx

## Workflow Pipeline

### STEP1:Generate the CNN Model

```bash
python create_CNN.py
```
Modify the parameters to generate your own CNN model, or directly use the pre-generated model we provide (e.g., simple_cnn_2+1.pth).

Meanwhile, import your newly generated model into **common.py**.

### STEP2:Extract CNN Model Weights

#### One-Click Extraction of Weights for Two Convolutional Layers
```bash
python Attack_all.py
```
This script performs weight extraction using PSP and sign recovery using RPCP. It fully demonstrates the extraction process of the two CNN layers in black-box mode, along with the corresponding precision comparison and experimental data.

#### Independent Recovery of the First Convolutional Layer Weights
```bash
python Attack_Layer1_PSP.py
```
This script recovers the weights of the first layer using the searched PSP, and displays the extraction precision, total recovery time, and the number of model queries.

OR

```bash
python Attack_Layer1_RPCP.py
```
This script directly recovers the weights using RPCP, and simultaneously displays experimental data such as extraction precision, recovery time, and the number of model queries.

### Independent Recovery of the Second Convolutional Layer Weights
```bash
Attack_Layer2_PSP.py
```
This script completes the recovery of the second convolutional layer using PSP and the weights of the first convolutional layer extracted in the previous step.

OR

```bash
Attack_Layer2_RPCP.py
```
This script implements the complete process of extracting and recovering the weights of the second layer via RPCP.
